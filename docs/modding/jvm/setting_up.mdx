This section needs to be rewritten, as it does not explain how to set up either program.\
Maybe link to another site that explains it better?

Here are some links to the download pages:

- [JDK (Java Development Kit) 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)
- [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Using a template

This is probably the simplest route, as as long as you have Git installed, or have access to our Github, you can download the example/template mod.
