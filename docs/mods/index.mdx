# Introduction

These docs assume you know at least the basics of Object Oriented Programming, the command line, 
your IDE, and the file system enough to run a few commands and move files around.\
Also, please note while these docs are focused primarily around Linux-based systems, alternative 
commands and utilities will always be present for Windows systems.\
I cannot say the same about Mac, sorry but you're on your own for a good majority of these docs.
