This page will show you how to set up a modding environment, starting with the intended method, and ending with a manual setup explanation.

### A notice to Scala users

We currently do not have an SBT plugin, so you will have to move around files and grab the maven links manually.\
We do plan on eventually making an SBT plugin, but its on the backburner and will be for a long while.

If someone would like to make an SBT plugin for 1D6, let us know and add it to the docs.

## Installing a JDK and IDE

:::note Editors Note; Ignore

This section needs to be rewritten, as it does not explain how to set up any of the programs.\
Maybe link to another site that explains it better?

:::

You need JDK 8, an IDE, and Git installed on your system of choice to write 1D6 mods.

Here are some links to their download pages:

- [JDK (Java Development Kit) 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)
- [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Creating the mod

From here you need to set up the mod itself.

### Using a template

This is probably the simplest route, as as long as you have Git installed,
or have access to our Github, you can download the example/template mod for any of the 3 languages you like.

:::info

These templates are still a work in progress, and wont be public for a while.

:::

### Using 4DElephant

This is 1D6's custom made Gradle plugin that helps with mod development.
The only difference between installing this alone rather than a template is some of the boilerplate code that you will have to write yourself.
