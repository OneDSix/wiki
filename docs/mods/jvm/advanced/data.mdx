Before we begin, you might want to know a bit about these topics:

- SQL Databases
- Docker, Docker Containers, and VMs
- Basic command line knowlagde

:::warning

This page assumes you're running a 1D6 server inside either a Docker Container, or a bare metal Linux/Unix system.\
This page may still be applicable for Windows users, but you will have to use the [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) ecosystem for it and run Docker locally.

## Basic Data Storage

The most basic method of data storage is saving the raw data itself in a readable format, say JSON, TOML, YAML, etc.
This can be acheved using just the APIs that 1D6 and LibGDX give you, alongside the Gson and Toml libraries bundled in.
