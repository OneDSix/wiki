Basemod is a large content and utility mod created by the 1D6 team and contributors so mod developers dont have to write everything themselves.

All the content in Basemod was separated for 2 reasons:
- Separation of concerns; 1D6 is already very large, so separating out all the content is probably the best option
- 1D6 by itself is meant to be a blank slate, with very few "solid" hooks, as its meant to be heavily modified using Mixins, Reflection, Java absurdity, and in some scenarios entire forks

There are currently 4 modules, listed [here](#all-basemod-modules) and below.

## Modules Explained

Each module has a purpose, some basic configs, and a few event handlers for when the module is loaded, enabled, disabled, or otherwise modified.
Some modules requires other modules as well,

Below is a basic example on how to enable, disable, and change the configs of a Basemod Module; in this case the `consumeables` module.
